Creating a Todo list

Write a class constructor that creates the todo in its own js file and import it to index. Then add it to a global array in index js
and have it be created as a div. Have another function that just populates the DOM. Then when you need to change the priority, 
set as complete, you just yank it from the array, edit it and then edit the DOM and repopulate it with repopulate function. Same for
editing other sections of the todo.

Would it be good code to fire off two functions from the event listener for logic and DOM?

For projects, just have the object that represents the specific todo in the array be spliced out (each todo will be given a unique ID 
that updates each time a todo is added or deleted) and added to the array that's created when you create a new project.

Basically this kind of feels like the library project, but with much more readable code this time around and expanded upon.

I just want to know if this logic is actually sound and follows the principles taught before I start work on coding it or if I'm off 
track and missing key details.
